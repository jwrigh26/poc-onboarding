            resident, you waive your rights under California Civil Code ยง1542,
            which says: "A general release does not extend to claims which the
            creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor at
            the time of executing the release, which if known by him or her must
            have materially affected his settlement with the debtor." And, if
            you are not a California resident, you waive your rights under any
            applicable statutes of a similar effect, to the fullest extent
            permissible under applicable law.
